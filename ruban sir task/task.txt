Javascript Test
1. Problem
const students = [
 { name: "Ram", age: 20, course: "PGDM" },
 { name: "Meha", age: 22, course: "PGFSD" },
 { name: "Amit", age: 21, course: "PGDM" },
 { name: "Sita", age: 23, course: "PGFSD" },
 { name: "Raj", age: 24, course: "PGDM" },
 { name: "Priya", age: 22, course: "PGFSD" },
 { name: "Karan", age: 25, course: "PGDM" },
 { name: "Anita", age: 21, course: "PGFSD" },
 { name: "Vikram", age: 23, course: "PGDM" },
 { name: "Neha", age: 22, course: "PGFSD" }
];
I. Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of student 
objects and returns the names of all students enrolled in 
the 'PGFSD' course.
II. Write a javascript function that takes a single input user 
name if it is in array it should send the details or it should 
send user not found
-----
2. Write a JavaScript function named generateNumbers that takes 
a single input type. If the input type is 1, the function should 
print all odd numbers from 1 to 100. If the input type is 2, the 
function should print all even numbers from 1 to 100. If the 
input is any other value, the function should throw an error 
indicating that the input is invalid.
Example:
generateNumbers(1);
// Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., 99
generateNumbers(2);
// Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 100
generateNumbers(3);
// Output: Error: Invalid input, please enter 1 for odd numbers or 2 for 
even numbers.
